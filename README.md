Exercise Gamification is a simulation-based fitness tracking system that rewards users with stars and hedons (pleasure points) for exercising. The system models user behavioral patterns and motivation through event-driven logic and reward decay mechanics.

Features:

    Turn-based simulation tracking activities and rewards based on user behavior.
    Star and hedon system implementing adaptive reward mechanics.
    Exercise fatigue modeling to reduce reward effectiveness over repeated actions.
    Optimal activity suggestion based on user motivation and activity history.

Skills & Concepts Used:

    Python and state management
    Simulation and event handling
    Decision algorithms for behavioral modeling
    Data tracking and condition-based rewards

How to Run:

    Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exercise-gamification.git
      cd exercise-gamification
    Run the program:
      python gamify.py
      
Future Enhancements:

    GUI for a user-friendly interface
    Machine learning for personalized rewards
    Integration with fitness tracking devices
